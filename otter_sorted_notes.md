All right, find some notes this morning or at least the things to do some research on.
So I want to do some research on how much for a sewing form and or how to make one myself.
I think that'd be cool.
Also, I do some research on getting a map of the local area to teach the girls orienteering, or map work and land navigation.
I think that would be really cool I need to do some research on bandoliers technical bandoleer I think that would be cool.
Need to Talk to Virginia about and Ally about if they want to get anything tonight to give the teachers tomorrow before the break something I had in my head that wanted to research on I can't think of it it'll come to me I want to research how to make a silicone mold to use with resin that would be interesting.
hydrophone hydrophobic fabric and hydrophobic ponchos.
Otter wax for rain rain proofing and weather proofing of fabric I had an interesting conversation with the girls too.
That eventually evolved into talking about clocks and compasses and maps, water and navigating the immensity of the world and then see the ocean existential horror of it all and all of it all.
They had made me have a really crazy thought about what if Captain Hook Up is trying to capture Peter Pan in order to get his compass back and wants the darling of kids in order to get a pocket watch from one of them in order to have a compass and watch so that way he can navigate his way back home away from Neverland.
Because without those two he can't travel in a straight line and doesn't know how fast he's traveling.
I think it's an intriguing thought as a character idea, as a story ideas twist on Peter Pan making making Captain Hook actually not the bad guy making him the good guy.
When he's giving him reasons for why he's doing what he's doing.
I think it's an interesting thought pattern.
So weather is really crap today.
I wonder if you can transcribe curse words.
Like fuck and shit and act to curiosity or motherfucker.
So we'll see if that works.
Want to do some research on voice detect AI how to build one from scratch, not relying on someone else's stuff or someone else's library out of thin training off of specific people's voices.
And then make it so that they can do it better and better and better.
The more conversations with those people at yours.
I think that would be an intriguing idea and then match that with a chatbot for d&d purposes.
I think that would be an important role playing game purposes.
I think that'd be an interesting thought.
I need to develop a mermaid graph for my OSR idea I think having something that actually lines out are lining up mechanics for it would be a good idea to get a visualization on it to help my brain work a little bit easier, a little bit better.
I think that'd be pretty cool.
Also thinking about going back and re working on a world built concept of you take start with earth and you go back in history to certain points, and then you extrapolate from there forward.
What if different things that happened or different people that happened or the geography was slightly different? What would that look like? See? See what the world looks like from there? I think that'd be an intriguing idea.
I'm still struggling with coming up with a good vision of a world both for my OSR build, but also for the book I want to write with the amnesiac socialites.
That woman whatever else and I can't tell if that's just procrastination and delaying because writing is not as easy as it used to be or I can't get my head wrapped around it.
Just depression I don't know how to look at that.
Look at figuring out some form of natural language processing for these notes to start working on how to extrapolate or extract stuff from them easier faster.
I think it'd be a good idea.
I really want to learn more on AI ml.
I need to start studying that.
I don't understand the concept as well as I want to read I feel to build one I got it right now

This is a test to see how well this works while I'm driving.
I'm really not certain if I like it yet, but I think it's one of those things that might take a little bit of time to get used to that and I'm hoping it works really, really well.
I don't know whether or not it's gonna keep continuing the recording and transcription while I'm switched over to Google Maps, but I hope it does be nice.
I need to do more research on the cost and how much time I get of transcription time, per whatever time period for free, hopefully, for free, that would be very, very nice.
Also one of those things, I'm curious how accurate is going to be and how well it's going to work in general.
This way I can actually take notes and get my head emptied.
While I'm driving.
I think that's going to be a good thing.
But we're going to see anyway, so I had this thought, or been having these thoughts about building a role playing game for quite a while and trying to figure out how to sort everything out in my head.
I think that having a simplified system sort of based on d&d would be a good thing because the kids and Elizabeth already are familiar with d&d, but also streamlining some of it because realistically, I want to focus on the narrative and I want to focus on the story and the characters and allow them to explore and be inventive and not necessarily worry about super crunchy rules.
That being said, I think for me because I'm used to having crunchy or rules.
Having something that is the framework for rule systems on how to handle things would be a good idea.
One of the ideas I have had is to have different skill levels when it comes to skill checks.
So it isn't necessarily about how skilled you are in something.
It's how much do you know and that adjusts how hard things are.
Instead of having it be something where you roll a die and you add the skill number and that your ability score and that determines this.
I think that as a general thing is this is what you have been taught and based on that what is considered what you know what was considered hard, easy, normal routine, based on what you know, instead of having it be just a set number, because I think that's more realistic.
If you think of it from the perspective of someone that's been training about or learning about something a lot, versus someone that just has the rudiments.
If you look at a high school student, doing algebra as an example, they're having to work on every single algebra problem and it takes them a while and it's something that they're still learning how to do and that's great.
And it's fine.
But if you ask most high school students, hey, do this basic math problem.
Some of them will be able to just pop it out of their head because they've practiced it so much that the answer just automatically comes to them.
Some not so much and they're just a pen, but it becomes very, very different.
Whereas if you have someone that is an has a degree in calculus as an example, we typically consider most algebra problems.
Pretty basic and pretty rudimentary, and thus be able to crank them out really, really fast, not really thinking and only work hard on higher level problems.
If you're looking at a boxer as an example, realistically, a boxer can throw a jab without thinking.
A boxer is going to be able to do the basic maneuvering without thinking they've done it so many times that their form is perfected.
And it's going to be the combination move.
It's going to be a very technical move that is very hard to pull off.
If you're untrained.
That's going to be what they are doing this hard.
Everything else is going to be pretty simple as straightforward.
As more of a question of how well can the other person avoid it? Is why it's a challenge.
Not because doing that maneuver is hard.
For them at least.
You'll get like gymnasts as an example.
If you have a Olympic level gymnast and you say hey, do a somersault there is no question that they're gonna be able to do it well.
You have them do anything any simple maneuver.
It's the routine where it's like this then this then this then this then this that hard, but okay, I want you know, you ask someone that's been doing parkour for ever in a day, hey, I want you to do this maneuver.
Okay, that's that's every data.
That's what they're doing.
And I think that's a better way of approaching it than just having it be a set.
This is the difficulty.
I think it should be the difficulty becomes relative.
Where, okay, you're, what is considered hard for an Olympian is not the same as what's considered hard for a layman.
As an example I liked the idea.
I have an obsession with with trying to figure out what numbers to use, though, because there's a part of me that likes this idea of like using primes and using like a civic Kony sequence as the way it advances because for whatever reason in my head, it has a a rhyme and a reason and a rhythm to it.
That makes it more organic that way I don't know why.
I'm still trying to figure that one out.
One of the other things I'm trying to figure out is how to handle it.
The rolling system.
I do think that one of the things that would like to do I like the idea of having skills or things you know how to do probably a better way of putting it and then you have next which are things specific things.
So it's the difference between having a skill in, let's say, baking, and you can bake things and given it you can get any recipe and bake it.
You can see we can do things off the top of your head a little bit harder.
You're not 100% Certain it'll come out the way you want to because you're experimenting.
But you have done this specific bread recipe let's say like, you are so comfortable with thinking about gas you can make the perfect baguette every time without trying even if your ingredients are not necessarily the best ingredients.
And that would be a neck so your skill would be baking.
And the neck under that skill would be get in that Knack would give you a bonus or some form of advantage or some form of perk in that specific thing.
And have all skills have that.
So it's something that you've either practiced a lot or is something that you have figured out.
But also have it be something that you can you can learn a knack without having the skill you know what if you don't know how to bake with anything, but you really you can make rolls.
You can make bread rolls all day long.
Because every every Thanksgiving that's what you make.
Don't Don't you know you're not gonna be able to do pastries, you're not gonna be able to do you know fancier bread rolls.
Oh, you got it.
And thus you can have characters that don't have skills in all areas in all these different areas but do have the ability to do specific one off things or learn specific one off thing without having them have to have a mechanical thing that basically says, oh, yeah, you learn this one off thing you learn how to make a pipe bomb.
Well, now you know all demolitions which is which is an unrealistic thing because being a demolitions expert is definitely more information in your head and more ability than being able to make a pipe bomb.
I think that is a way of approaching it.
And now that I think about it, I think that we could take it one step further.
See things you know how to do you have max that you have, like the specific thing inside that's normally under the under a skill inside of a skill that you can do just really well because you've practiced it so much.
And then you could have recipes or some sort of thing that said, That is the instruction that says, do this, then this then this, then this and as long as you follow this instruction, you can do this.
But it would be I think it's that sort of thing.
would be an actual item that if you have that instruction and then you could actually have it be something that would make it so you can do something even though you don't have to sell for at a level that is better than yours.
Because you're not as good as an expert.
But it would give you a didn't show it's not quite like a knack or it's like giving somebody an act.
Now that makes sense.
