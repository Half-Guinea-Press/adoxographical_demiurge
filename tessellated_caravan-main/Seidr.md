In [Old Norse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse "Old Norse"), **_seiðr_** (sometimes anglicized as _seidhr_, _seidh_, _seidr_, _seithr_, _seith_, or _seid_) was a type of [magic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(paranormal) "Magic (paranormal)") which was practised in [Norse society](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings "Vikings") during the [Late Scandinavian Iron Age](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age_Scandinavia "Iron Age Scandinavia"). The practice of _seiðr_ is believed to be a form of magic which is related to both the telling and the shaping of the future. Connected to the [Old Norse religion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse_religion "Old Norse religion"), its origins are largely unknown, and the practice of it gradually declined after the [Christianization of Scandinavia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianization_of_Scandinavia "Christianization of Scandinavia"). Accounts of _seiðr_ later made it into sagas and other literary sources, while further evidence of it has been unearthed by [archaeologists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology "Archaeology"). Various scholars have debated the nature of _seiðr_, some of them have argued that it was [shamanic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism "Shamanism") in context, involving visionary journeys by its practitioners.
