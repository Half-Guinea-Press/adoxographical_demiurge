	- How does a magician tap his/her magic power? 
	- Does becoming a magician require some rite of passage (investing one’s power in an object, being chosen by the gods, constructing or being given a permanent link to the source of power) or does it just happen naturally, as a gradual result of much study or as a part of growing up?
	- What do you need to do to cast a spell — design an elaborate ritual, recite poetry, mix the right ingredients in a pot?
