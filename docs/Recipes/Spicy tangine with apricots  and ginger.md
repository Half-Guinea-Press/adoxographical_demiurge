2 tablespoons olive oil plus a pat of butter

1 onion, finely chopped.

3 fresh rosemary sprigs, I finely chopped, the other 2 cut in half 1½ inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped

2 fresh red chiles, seeded and finely chopped

1-2 cinnamon sticks

8 chicken thighs

6 oz. ready-to-eat dried apricots

2 tablespoons clear, runny hohey

14-oz. can plum tomatoes with juice sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

leaves from a small bunch of fresh green or purple basil

Plain, Buttery Couscous (see page

108), to serve

Heat the oil and butter in a tagine or heavy-based casserole dish. Add the onion, chopped rosemary, ginger, and chiles and sauté until the onion begins to soften.

Stir in the halved rosemary sprigs and the cinnamon sticks. Add the chicken thighs and brown them on both sides. Toss in the apricots with the honey, then stir in the plum tomatoes with their juice. (Add a little water if necessary, to ensure there is enough liquid to cover the base of the tagine and submerge the apricots.) Bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce the heat. Cover and simmer gently for 35-40 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.

Season to taste with salt and pepper. Shred the larger basil leaves and leave the small ones intact. Sprinkle them over the chicken and serve with Plain, Buttery Couscous and leafy salad greens, if liked.
